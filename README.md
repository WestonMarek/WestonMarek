- Howdy, I’m @WestonMarek
I am working mostly in Python on a variety of projects. Some may be updated here, however, most will not be. 
The work that I'm doing all pertains to GIS or small scripts for hobbies. 

- Below is a list of interesting maps and documents that I have come accross on the internet.
